Job 1: annotating filtered filtered/new_test_infile_12aug_filtered.smap with files in /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/data and custom database /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/data/test_db.bed...

Waiting at most 60 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 22 of /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 60 seconds:
annotated/new_test_infile_12aug_annotated.csv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 1 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
