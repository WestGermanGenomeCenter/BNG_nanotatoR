Waiting at most 60 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 49 of /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 60 seconds:
converted/rvp_test_infile_converted.smap
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
