MissingOutputException in line 48 of /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
converted/t1_kb_infile_converted.smap
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 3 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 3
Removing output files of failed job convert since they might be corrupted:
converted/t1_kb_infile_header.smap
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
