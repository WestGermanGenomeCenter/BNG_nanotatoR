Job 3: converting input/43811_assembly_151_variants_combine_filters_inMoleRefine1.smap with input/43811_assembly_151_variants_combine_filters_inMoleRefine1_header.tx ...

Waiting at most 60 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 57 of /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 60 seconds:
converted/43811_assembly_151_variants_combine_filters_inMoleRefine1_converted.smap
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 3 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 3
Shutting down, this might take some time.
