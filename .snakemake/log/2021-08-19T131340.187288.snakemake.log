Job 1: annotating filtered filtered/43868_assembly_151_variants_combine_filters_inMoleRefine1_filtered.smap with files in /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/data and custom database /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/data/database_own_samples.bed...

Waiting at most 60 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 22 of /home/daric/work_WGGC/SV_annotation/sv_nanotation_snake/workflow/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 60 seconds:
annotated/43868_assembly_151_variants_combine_filters_inMoleRefine1_annotated.csv
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 1 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 1
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
